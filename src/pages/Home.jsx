                    <h5 className="text-title">Programming</h5>
                    <div className="text">Learning to code teaches you problem-solving and promotes teamwork. Programmers make anywhere from $70,000 to over $200,000. At Code Club, we teach you the methods, disciplines, and languages that many companies use today. From learning how to work in teams and build big projects with GitHub, to learning must-needed languages such as Python and HTML/CSS/JS frameworks. Code Club wants you to participate in helping out and developing impressive projects, so even if you do not know much, our members are always willing to help out. Knowing how to program before college is very impressive to colleges, even if you donâ€™t want to major in computer science. </div>
                    <h5 className="text-title">Volunteering</h5>
                    <div className="text">BT Code Club gives members the opportunity to volunteer. Partering with tutoring program Recoursive, run by our co-leader Noah Kim, students teach basic programming all throughout select Bergen County libraries to young kids. Members can also build projects for other clubs such as websites or source code for volunteer hours. This will be a good opportunity to both gain volunteer hours and contribute to both the Bergen Tech and Bergen County community. </div>
                    <h5 className="text-title">Competing</h5>
                    <div className="text">Competing is a great opportunity to showcase skills and build your college application. Code Club brings members all across the state to participate in Hackathons, where students work with others and use their programming skills to make projects to solve a social issue. Students have the opportunity to participate in ACSL and USACO, computer science competitions where an algorithm is created to get a desired output. Students get the chance to participate in CTFs, competitions where people in a team are challenged to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a system to capture a "flag" or piece of information to win. </div>
